# Hard: Escape Plan
# 
# You are a land surveyor, and you use the latest 
# land-surveying technology: robotic surveyors. You have 
# sent your robots to survey a remote field, since it is 
# cheaper and easier to send them than to go yourself. You 
# know that there are frequent sand storms that blow through 
# the field, which can damage the robots. Fortunately, 
# satellite imagery can detect these storms and give the 
# robots a warning several seconds before a storm arrives.
# 
# Since the field is so exposed and remote, the only way a 
# robot can protect itself is to run to a hole in the ground 
# and hide. You have identified the locations of several of 
# these holes, but each of them is large enough to fit only 
# one robot. Any robot that doesnâ€™t make it into a hole before 
# the storm arrives will be damaged.
# 
# Write a program that will figure out how many robots can 
# escape a coming storm by running to and hiding in holes. 
# Assume that each robot that can escape travels from 
# its current position directly to a hole. All robots 
# travel at a speed of 10 meters per second.
